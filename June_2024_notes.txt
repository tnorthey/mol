First I ran a loop of 10 ccv_start_initial.sh
I ran submission_script_0.sh 0 0 
Then, submission_script_1.sh 

(which will take hours / overnight)
It takes ~7 mins per time-step and does 59 steps (hence 7 hours)
Finally, I probably will manually improve the fitting by lots of submission_script_0 X Y going back and forth over the run indices
- I want to compare this to the already done "newnew" runs which went back over
- What exactly does submission_script_0 do? Add this to the paper...`

What I did:



TO DO:
wrap.py change "tmp_/" to a target directory
- gives the ability to run simultaneous fittings (e.g. different molecules)

- run same but qmax=4
- same but with noise
- same but qmax=4 and noise
