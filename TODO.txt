wrap->chd_1d() unit test

1 huge jump from start.xyz to step75 traj094 (fully stretched hexatriene)
- It might be possible with strong C-C and C-H bonds...

Implement backwards steps!

test larger C-C HO terms; the first step uses this and works well.. So maybe it will continue.

traj094: 10 20 32 35 37 40 44 50 55 60 65 70 75

ONE input file that gets copied to tmp_/

I think noiseless data was actually a red herring (i.e. misled / distracted me); I wasted time trying to optimise that perfectly
 - real data has some noise
 - it's meant to be for experimentalists 
 - and for realistically optimising multiple experimental datasets

noise
 - creates a non-zero "global" minimum in f_signal
 - is more realistic for approximating experimental data
 - load in target data; avoid generating different noise every time...
 - to approx. "real" data start at q = 0.5 
 - PLOT, write f_signal / f_signal_true, w. f_signal_true is the true signal fit to the noisy data

fix 2D
 - code Mats' correct detector projection (his thesis)
 - show that another dimension of data massively helps
