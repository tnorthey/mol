I think noiseless data was actually a red herring (i.e. misled / distracted me); I wasted time trying to optimise that perfectly
 - real data has some noise
 - it's meant to be for experimentalists 
 - and for realistically optimising multiple experimental datasets

noise
 - creates a non-zero "global" minimum in f_signal
 - is more realistic for approximating experimental data
 - load in target data; avoid generating different noise every time...
 - to approx. "real" data start at q = 0.5 

fix 2D
 - code Mats' correct detector projection (his thesis)
 - show that another dimension of data massively helps
