[DONE!] - one input file. Nothing else changes
  - already have the params module; it's a start
    - something like that but "input.py" (possibly still with the params module)
[DONE!] - one run.py file that doesn't need to be edited. And it's callable by just "python run.py"

- simplify functions: single-use, individual tests etc.
  - (specify exact to do list here...)

- "dat" mode working + test

- "xyz" mode test

- 0 step run + test
  - fbest as input (or "f_start")

- README: description of each variable in input.json

- Optional: remove scipy dependency?

I think noiseless data was actually a red herring (i.e. misled / distracted me); I wasted time trying to optimise that perfectly
 - real data has some noise
 - it's meant to be for experimentalists 
 - and for realistically optimising multiple experimental datasets

noise
 - creates a non-zero "global" minimum in f_signal
 - is more realistic for approximating experimental data

fix 2D
 - code Mats' correct detector projection (his thesis)
 - show that another dimension of data massively helps


... write the readme
