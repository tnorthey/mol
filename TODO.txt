[DONE!] - "Sampling ratio" where it initially runs without signal fitting for x% of the steps to pseudo Wigner sample
- automatically run the normal modes with pyscf
- automatically find the bonds and apply the correct FF params to them
- conda etc., describe in README

- auto copy input.json to results dir
- auto create results dir if doesn't exist (with a boolean choice to do this)

[DONE!] - one input file. Nothing else changes
[DONE!] - one run.py file that doesn't need to be edited. And it's callable by just "python run.py"
[DONE!] - "xyz" mode test
[DONE!] - "dat" mode working + test
[DONE!] - 0 step run + test
  - fbest as input (or "f_start")
[DONE!] - Fix NMM pcd...

- simplify functions: single-use, individual tests etc.
  - (specify exact to do list here...)

- README: description of each variable in input.json

I think noiseless data was actually a red herring (i.e. misled / distracted me); I wasted time trying to optimise that perfectly
 - real data has some noise
 - it's meant to be for experimentalists 
 - and for realistically optimising multiple experimental datasets

noise
 - creates a non-zero "global" minimum in f_signal
 - is more realistic for approximating experimental data

... write the readme
